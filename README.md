This is my timekeeping machine using CNN models for anti face spoofing/recognition and fingerprint for identification. 
I also design and intergrated GUI and Web app for user interaction and management.

# Objective
- Detect faces quickly and accurately, resist face fraud methods such as printed photos, images, videos, masks, etc.
- Distinguishing faces that are in the database from faces that are not in the database.
- Distinguishing between fingerprints in the database and fingerprints not in the database.
- Fully functional and easy to use GUI. Supports registering/deleting users, managing user entry/exit time information.
- Web app supports user information management and timekeeping

# Main components
- Jetson Nano B01 4gb
- USB Webbcam
- Fingerprint sensor AS608
- LCD Waveshare 7inch with touchpad
